# What is containers ?

A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.&#x20;

[It is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/).&#x20;

Containers are used to build, share, and run applications. [They are portable and can be used across different computing environments, such as Linux and Windows-based applications](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/).
