# Kubernetes for Beginners

### Pr-requisite to learn Kubernetes <a href="#pre-requisite" id="pre-requisite"></a>

Before jumping into kubernetes you need to have fair amount of knowledge of some technologies and concepts

1. [Distributed System](https://youtu.be/rYK-kTBUrK4?si=kl7dBfXOl9bnYA34)\
   Learn about distributed system basics & their use cases in modern IT infrastructure.\

2. Key-value store ( No-SQL Database )\
   Understand just enough basics and their use cases.\

3. API ( Application programming interface )\
   Kubernetes is an API-driven system. So you need to have an understanding of RESTFUL APIs.\

4. [YAML ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwLBfZFrLgI)( YAML Ain’t Markup Language )\
   It is a data serialization language that can be used for data storage and configuration files. It’s very easy to learn and from a Kubernetes standpoint, we will use it for configuration files.\

5. Containers\
   Container is the basic building block of Kubernetes. The primary work of Kubernetes is to orchestrate containers. You need to learn all the container basics and have hands-on experience working on container tools like Docker or Podman.\

6. Service Discovery\
   It is one of the key areas of Kubernetes. You need to have basic knowledge of client-side and server-side service discovery. To put it simply, in client-side service discovery, the request goes to a service registry to get the endpoints available for backend services.\

7. Docker\
   Learn docker and basic commads of dockers
