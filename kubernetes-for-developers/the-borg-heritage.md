# The Borg Heritage

What primarily distinguishes Kubernetes from other systems is its heritage. Kubernetes is inspired by Borg - the internal system used by Google to manage its applications (e.g. Gmail, Apps, GCE).&#x20;

With Google pouring the valuable lessons they learned from writing and operating Borg for over 15 years into Kubernetes, this makes Kubernetes a safe choice when having to decide on what system to use to manage containers. While a powerful tool, part of the current growth in Kubernetes is making it easier to work with and handle workloads not found in a Google data center.
