# Multi-Container Pod

It may not make sense to recreate an entire image to add functionality like a shell or logging agent. Instead, you could add another container to the Pod, which would provide the necessary tools.

Each container in the Pod should be transient and decoupled. If adding another container limits the scalability or transient nature of the original application, then a new build may be warranted.

Every container in a Pod shares a single IP address and namespace. Each container has equal potential access to storage given to the Pod. Kubernetes does not provide any locking, so your configuration or application should be such that containers do not have conflicting writes.



There are three terms often used for multi-container pods: _ambassador_, _adapter_, and _sidecar_. Based off of the documentation, you may think there is some setting for each.

### Ambassador

This type of secondary container would be used to communicate with outside resources, often outside the cluster. Using a proxy, like Envoy or other, you can embed a proxy instead of using one provided by the cluster. It is helpful if you are unsure of the cluster configuration.

### Adapter

This type of secondary container is useful to modify the data generated by the primary container. For example, the Microsoft version of ASCII is distinct from everyone else. You may need to modify a datastream for proper use.

### Sidecar

Similar to a sidecar on a motorcycle, it does not provide the main power, but it does help carry stuff. A sidecar is a secondary container which helps or provides a service not found in the primary application. Logging containers are a common sidecar.
