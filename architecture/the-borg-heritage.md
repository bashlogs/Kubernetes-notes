# The Borg Heritage

Kubernetes is inspired by Borg - the internal system used by Google to manage its applications (e.g. Gmail, Apps, GCE).

With Google pouring the valuable lessons they learned from writing and operating Borg for over 15 years into Kubernetes, this makes Kubernetes a safe choice when having to decide on what system to use to manage containers. While a powerful tool, part of the current growth in Kubernetes is making it easier to work with and handle workloads not found in a Google data center.
